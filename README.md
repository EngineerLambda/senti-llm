# Customer Support Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis Functionality

This application combines AI and sentiment analysis tools to function as a customer service bot, allowing users to submit reviews and receive immediate assistance. It is particularly useful for builders and service providers with a large customer base, as it reduces the need to hire additional customer service agents, thereby lowering costs and increasing profits.

Tools Used:

1. Hugging Face Pipeline: Provides the sentiment analysis model to evaluate the customerâ€™s review before passing it on to the AI.


2. Langchain: Serves as the AI platform for generating chatbot responses.


3. Python: The entire application is built using Python.


4. Gradio: Used to develop the chat interface.



Users can simply enter their review in the provided space and submit it using a dedicated button. The AI then generates a response within seconds, based on the sentiment analysis.
